baseskills,How to interact on base chain,"# Base Chain (L2) — minimal agent skill

This skill teaches an agent the **smallest set of steps** needed to **read from** and **write to** the **Base** blockchain using TypeScript.

---

## 0) Quick facts

- **Network (mainnet):** Base  
  - `chainId`: **8453**
  - RPC: `https://mainnet.base.org`
  - Explorer: `https://basescan.org`

- **Network (testnet):** Base Sepolia  
  - `chainId`: **84532**
  - RPC: `https://sepolia.base.org`
  - Explorer: `https://sepolia.basescan.org`

Base supports standard Ethereum JSON-RPC and EVM tooling (EIP-155, EIP-1559, ERC-20, etc.).


---

## 1) Setup (TypeScript + viem)

Install:
```bash
bun add viem
# or: npm i viem
```

Environment variables (example):
```bash
# pick one
BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org

# for writes only
PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

---

## 2) Minimal read-only client

```ts
import { createPublicClient, http, formatEther } from ""viem"";
import { base, baseSepolia } from ""viem/chains"";

const chain = base; // or baseSepolia
const rpcUrl = process.env.BASE_RPC_URL!; // or BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL

export const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain,
  transport: http(rpcUrl),
});

// Example: native ETH balance
export async function getEthBalance(address: `0x${string}`) {
  const wei = await publicClient.getBalance({ address });
  return formatEther(wei);
}
```

Common read calls:
- `getBalance`
- `getBlockNumber`
- `getBlock`
- `readContract` (ERC-20 balances, etc.)

---

## 3) Minimal write client (send ETH)

```ts
import { createWalletClient, http, parseEther } from ""viem"";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from ""viem/accounts"";
import { base, baseSepolia } from ""viem/chains"";

const chain = base; // or baseSepolia
const rpcUrl = process.env.BASE_RPC_URL!;
const account = privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as `0x${string}`);

export const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain,
  transport: http(rpcUrl),
});

export async function sendEth(to: `0x${string}`, amountEth: string) {
  const hash = await walletClient.sendTransaction({
    to,
    value: parseEther(amountEth),
  });
  return hash; // tx hash
}
```

Wait for confirmation:
```ts
import { publicClient } from ""./publicClient"";

export async function wait(hash: `0x${string}`) {
  return publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash });
}
```

---

## 4) ERC-20 basics (balance + transfer)

Minimal ERC-20 ABI:
```ts
const erc20Abi = [
  { name: ""decimals"", type: ""function"", stateMutability: ""view"", inputs: [], outputs: [{ type: ""uint8"" }] },
  { name: ""balanceOf"", type: ""function"", stateMutability: ""view"", inputs: [{ name: ""owner"", type: ""address"" }], outputs: [{ type: ""uint256"" }] },
  { name: ""transfer"", type: ""function"", stateMutability: ""nonpayable"", inputs: [{ name: ""to"", type: ""address"" }, { name: ""amount"", type: ""uint256"" }], outputs: [{ type: ""bool"" }] },
] as const;
```

Read token balance:
```ts
import { publicClient } from ""./publicClient"";

export async function getTokenBalance(token: `0x${string}`, owner: `0x${string}`) {
  const bal = await publicClient.readContract({
    address: token,
    abi: erc20Abi,
    functionName: ""balanceOf"",
    args: [owner],
  });
  return bal; // bigint (raw units)
}
```

Transfer (safe flow: simulate -> write):
```ts
import { walletClient } from ""./walletClient"";
import { publicClient } from ""./publicClient"";

export async function transferToken(token: `0x${string}`, to: `0x${string}`, amountRaw: bigint) {
  const { request } = await publicClient.simulateContract({
    account: walletClient.account,
    address: token,
    abi: erc20Abi,
    functionName: ""transfer"",
    args: [to, amountRaw],
  });

  const hash = await walletClient.writeContract(request);
  return hash;
}
```

---

## 6) “Interact with any contract” pattern (read + write)

### Read
```ts
await publicClient.readContract({
  address: CONTRACT,
  abi,
  functionName: ""someViewFn"",
  args: [...],
});
```

### Write (always simulate first)
```ts
const { request } = await publicClient.simulateContract({
  account: walletClient.account,
  address: CONTRACT,
  abi,
  functionName: ""someWriteFn"",
  args: [...],
  value: 0n, // optional
});
const hash = await walletClient.writeContract(request);
```

---

## 7) Common pitfalls

- **Wrong chain**: check `chainId` and RPC match.
- **Units**: ERC-20 amounts are usually `bigint` in smallest units.
- **RPC rate limits**: retry on transient errors; use a paid RPC if needed.
- **Finality**: Base is fast, but still wait for receipts for safety.

---

## 8) Minimal checklist for an agent

When user asks to do something on Base:

1. Determine **network** (Base mainnet vs Base Sepolia).
2. Use `publicClient` to **fetch context** (balances, token decimals, contract state).
3. If writing:
   - Send (`writeContract` / `sendTransaction`)
   - Wait for receipt
4. Return:
   - tx hash
   - explorer link
   - status (success/revert) and any relevant outputs/events
